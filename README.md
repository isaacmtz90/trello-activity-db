# glee

Glee is a back-end starting point for development teams who use a specific stack of technologies and methodologies (see below). Glee includes build scripts, sample/template code and everything you need to quick-start back-end development. Glee's requirements were inspired by https://gist.github.com/bsommardahl/c2d57d51242b2336b7876f20fcf16ac6.

Glee provides a basic Rest API template:

+ ES6 + babel,
  + Removes Flow type annotations,
  + Transforms imports to lazy CommonJS requires,
  + Transforms async/await to generators,
+ [ESLint][eslint] with the [airbnb-base][airbnb-base] and [flowtype][eslint-flowtype] rules,
+ [Jest][jest] unit testing and coverage,
+ [Type definitions][flow-typed] for Jest,
+ [NPM scripts for common operations](#available-scripts),
+ [.editorconfig][editorconfig] for consistent file format,
+ [Yarn][yarn] lockfile so only verified and up-to-date dependencies are installed.
+ PostreSQL Database integration with migrations
+ Feature Toggling
+ Authentication by JWT (requires separate IDP for auth and user management)
+ API documentation by Swagger (auto-generated)
+ Automated Acceptance Testing with Cucumber
+ CloudFormation configuration
+ Docker container
+ Buildkite configuration
+ Command Dispatching with MotoTaxi
+ Guidance for CQRS architecture

## Global Install

`npm install -g yarn`

## Database Setup
You need PostgreSQL to run glee locally. To install postgres on Ubuntu, check out this awesome tutorial: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04 (for Windows, head to google).

Glee comes with default database configurarion for `localhost`. You can change your db config by modifying `./src/config/sequelize.js`. This config file is ignored by git, so it will not get checked in with your secrets.

## Quick start

This project requires [Node.js][nodejs] 8.2 or later and [NPM][npm], [Yarn][yarn] is optional but recommended. Make sure you have those installed. Then just type following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/acklenavenue/glee
cd glee
yarn
yarn run first-time
```
## Logging Setup
Glee comes with default logging configurarion for Loggly.com. You can change your logging config by modifying `./src/config/loggly.js`. This config file is ignored by git, so it will not get checked in with your secrets.

## Available scripts

Run using either `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` comand.

+ `clean` - remove coverage data, Jest cache and transpiled files,
+ `lint` - lint source files and tests,
+ `typecheck` - check type annotations,
+ `test` - lint, typecheck and run tests with coverage,
+ `test-only` - run tests with coverage,
+ `test:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run tests, 
+ `build` - compile source files,
+ `build:watch` - interactive watch mode, compile sources on change.
+ `aat` - run automated acceptance tests

## Questions

If you have any questions regarding this project:

* consult the [FAQ][wiki-faq] wiki page first,
* search for [issues marked as *question*][issues-question],
* if none of the above is appropriate, [open an issue][new-issue].

## Inspiration

This boilerplate was initially inspired by [Jakub Synowiec](https://github.com/jsynowiec/node-flowtype-boilerplate), but taken several steps further to include a basic Hapi-based REST API with CQRS-style command dispatching.
